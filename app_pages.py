        Isabella and Rachel during the very first round!  Here, we share an overview of our 
        journey, which we hope you may be able to take as inspiration to start your own

                    <p><strong>A bit of history (<em>circa</em> Nov 2020)</strong></p>
                    <p> BuddyMeUp is the brainchild of Isabella, who was sitting down and drinking a 
                        relaxing cup of tea one day when she suddenly realized that she did not want to lose the edge 
                        off her coding skills.
                    </p>

                <div class='list-logo-container list-logo-clock-container'>
                    {clock_logo_html}
                </div>
            </div>
            <p> So she put out a call on the WWCPython Slack group for like-minded 
                people who would like to be buddied up together for some regular pair-programming.
                More than a dozen people signed up for this pilot round, and Isabella personally 
                and carefully matched each pair together based on responses on the sign-up forms.  
                It was a success and everyone enjoyed their eight weeks of fun!<br>
                In particular, Isabella matched with Rachel to refine the buddy-matching process 
                in anticipation of the program going viral, which would render manual matching tedious.  
                (Spoiler: the next round of BuddyMeUp attracted nearly 80 buddies from all around 
                the world!!)

                        If you have filled out the BuddyMeUp sign-up form, you may have wondered why 
                        there were sooo many questions to answer.  
                        Well, we are feeding your info (in a non-creepy way) to a custom 
                        algorithm which combines linear programming using Python's 
                        <tt style='font-size: 1.1em'>PuLP</tt> library and some 
                        natural language processing (NLP) using Python's 
                        <tt style='font-size: 1.1em'>scikit-learn</tt> library, 
                        to calculate optimal matches based on your responses.

                The <span class='highlight-topic highlight-keyword'>NLP</span> 
                part is used to analyse your text-based responses about your objectives and 
                the bit where you describe yourself, and measure your similarity to 
                other participants' responses (for example, based on frequencies of certain words).
            </p>
            <p>
                The <span class='highlight-topic highlight-keyword'>linear programming</span> 
                part considers how similar your stated preferences (for gender, timezone, 
                experience level, etc.) are to each of the other participants', 
                together with how similar your goals and interests are as determined by the NLP score above, 
                and assigns you a score indicating how good a match you are with each of the others.
                This score is calculated by maximizing the overall sum of scores 
                between each possible pairing.<br>
                The person with whom you scored the highest is then assigned as your buddy! üçí

            <p>
                Much like how Amazon recommends you stuff you never knew you needed, or 
                how Google knows what you want to search for almost before you begin typing, 
                the more information we can gather, the better a match we could find for you &ndash; 
                that is why we ask you to try to be as explicit as possible about your objectives 
                and descriptions about yourself.  (But rest assured, we cannot tell what your 
                favourite beverage or who your celebrity crush is based on the info we collect!)

                    <p>
                        After sorting out the matching algorithm, we thought: 
                        "How cool would it be to build a web application where buddies could sign up, 
                        and the info could be stored automatically (instead of having to download and 
                        format CSV files from Google Forms)?" <br>
                        Answer: Very cool!  No practical idea how to go about it, but very cool in theory üòé.

                We began by looking at different Python 
                <span class='highlight-topic highlight-keyword'>web application frameworks</span> and 
                settled on <tt style="font-size: 1.1em">streamlit</tt>, which is designed for data science 
                applications and thus allowed us to focus more on the data part and less on the 
                web part.  This enabled us to have an app up and running very quickly on 
                our local machines for testing.
            </p>
            <p>
                Data from buddies is the most important part of our application.  Therefore, we spent 
                significant time designing the sign-up form in such a way to collect 
                the necessary information, yet be fun to fill in.  You will need to obtain a BuddyMeUp
                key to unlock the Python-track sign-up form, but here is a glimpse of 
                part of the form where we ask for your location data, and the map underneath your input 
                would try to pinpoint your location and 
                print out your timezone almost in real-time after you've entered the info:<br>
                <div class='resource-img-container'>
                    <figure>
                        {map_img_html}
                    </figure>
                    <figcaption class='resource-img-caption'>
                        Using a map as an auto-location-checker in the BuddyMeUp 
                        <span style='display: inline-block'>Python-track</span> sign-up form.
                    </figcaption>
                </div>
            </p>
            <p>
                Then we needed a <span class='highlight-topic highlight-keyword'>database</span> 
                to store the data securely.  We used a PostgreSQL database 
                for the backend, and started by filling all the info into one giant table.  
                Although it was simple to store the data this way, it was not efficient for retrieval.  
                Also, typically each row in the table represents a unique buddy, so we had 
                to think about the scenario when a buddy signs up for another round &ndash; 
                it would not make sense to create a duplicate row for the same person containing mostly the 
                same info (same name, email, location, etc.), but different starting dates and matched buddy.  
                We iterated through several designs before settling on using five tables to 
                store various aspects of the data:<br>
                <div class='resource-img-container'>
                    <figure>
                        {schema_img_html}
                    </figure>
                    <figcaption class='resource-img-caption'>
                        Database schema for storing buddies' data.

                <div class='list-item-container'>
                    <p>
                        Finally, once we have tested the frontend and backend on our local machines, 
                        we were ready to <span class='highlight-topic highlight-keyword'>deploy</span> 
                        the app online!  We chose the Heroku platform 
                        because it supports Python apps built on <tt style='font-size: 1.1em'>streamlit</tt>, 
                        is very simple to set up, 
                        and (importantly) the free tier is sufficient for our needs!  
                        (Of course, there are costs for "free" things &ndash; one being that 
                        you may find the server to be a bit slow to spin up when you first
                        load the app...)

                        Isabella and Rachel met at least weekly over several months to 
                        discuss the design and development of this project.  
                        We have both learned a lot from each other and from Stack Overflow,

                On the other hand, Rachel loves eating avocados and then saving the seeds 
                to grow into plants, which often feature in the background of her Zoom calls.  
                This prompted Isabella to try her hand at growing one herself... with success!

                We actually spent quite a bit of time discussing the best conditions for growing 
                avocado plants from seed, and whether our respective plants seem to be happy or not  
                (avocado seeds can be tricky sometimes &ndash; you can give them all the care 
                in the world by keeping them moist and temperature-controlled, but they could appear 
                inactive for months, until just when you've given up hope and are about to discard them, 
                they start to sprout!).
